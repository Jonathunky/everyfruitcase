# iPad Smart Cover
Now that was a seriously revolutionary stuff.

March 25th, 2011, marked the release of iPad 2, which was tremendously improved on its predecessor in every meaningful way. Among these improvements was the introduction of Smart Covers, which enabled the iPad to be put into sleep mode when the cover was closed and to wake up when the cover was opened.

Here's the part about Smart Covers in AnandTech review: https://www.anandtech.com/show/4225/the-ipad-2-review/10. A "really neat accessory" indeed!

Apple offered two types of Smart Covers: Polyurethane covers for $39.00, and for those seeking a touch of luxury, leather covers were available for a nice premium of $69.00. Both types were compatible with the iPad 2, "the new iPad", and iPad 4.
