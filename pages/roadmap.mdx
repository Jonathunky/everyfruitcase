# Roadmap

I first conceived the idea for EveryCase in the spring of 2023. If you're reading this, it signifies that the website has already reached Early Access milestone. How wonderful!

I’ll keep introducing fixes, improvements, and new collections — whenever Apple releases them.

#### Plans for foreseeable future include:

- Adding more case images (I'm manually doing transparent backgrounds 🥲)
- Increasing image quality — as soon as [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KdlJlHAAbQ) [company](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETXQUkp-VOg) implements AVIF in Microsoft Edge
- Improving code (comments, readability, etc.)
- Localizations of EveryCase to other languages
- More bad writing 🤗
- Small tweaks and fixes here and there

#### Long-term ideas:

Should the stars align – say, this site garners immense traction, and I find myself both swimming in free time and eager to delve further into web development – I'll start building EveryCase 2.0. Expect this iteration to be more dynamic, interactive, and packed with features tailored for collectors.

I'm new to web development, and I’ll have to learn a lot, so this will take significant effort and time.
