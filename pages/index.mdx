# Hello there!

So you may have heard about [EveryMac](https://everymac.com/), the old-school yet functional catalogue of Apple devices, complete with specs, order numbers, and more. You may have also used [Bandbreite](https://bandbreite.watch/), a sleek and modern app for collecting Apple Watch bands.

And you kept wondering: shouldn't there be at least one resource dedicated to device cases manufactured by Apple? Like that [Pink Citrus Leather Sleeve](Late_2020/iphone_drop) you slide your iPhone 12 mini into every day?

Or that [Peony Pink Leather Case](Late_2018/iphone_drop) on your iPhone Xs, which you're still using as a backup phone because not all carriers support eSIM Quick Transfer, and you cannot just go to a carrier office for a replacement QR code because it's kinda located on the other side of the planet?

A website designed for people who have never lost a thing in their life yet still bought an AirTag 4-pack with a bunch of accessories just to show off their love for Wisteria?

Yeah. Same with me, mate. Same with me.

So, I've decided to never wonder again and to build such a website. The problem is solved now.

Welcome!
