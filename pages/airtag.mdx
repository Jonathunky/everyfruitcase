# AirTag & Accessories

In Spring 2021, Apple released one of their most useful accessories yet: an AirTag tracker, destined to find all your lost items. And surely enough, Apple also released numerous accessories for it.

Very quickly, both Silicone and Leather Loop were discontinued, and only the Leather Key Rings remained in production, later replaced by FineWoven Key Ring after Wonderlust Apple Event.
