# It's free real website!

And it respects visitors. That's why Finest Woven:

- Does not track you in any way, shape, or form
- Does not embed personalized ads
- Does not use any elements from big tech corpos that could compromise user privacy

And most likely never will. It's also dead fast, **100% non-intrusive**, and uses
privacy-preserving [Vercel Analytics](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics).

So I'm once again asking for your support if you enjoy it, and for
your [feedback](https://github.com/Jonathunky/everyfruitcase/issues/new?title=General%20Feedback&labels=feedback).

Thanks ever so much!

I also promise to donate 10% of your contributions towards aiding Ukraine 🇺🇦. The funds will be transferred directly to
the squads fighting on the battlefield. They use these donations to purchase additional gear such as ballistic vests,
diesel generators, drones, pickup trucks, and other necessary equipment.

However, if you prefer not to contribute towards this cause, please let me know by leaving a comment when making a
donation, and I will respect your choice. Thanks.
