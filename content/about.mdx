# Credits and such

This website is being meticulously crafted on <span style={{color: 'pink'}}>**Lovedead**</span> island by [@JonathanSeriesX](https://evgenii.org), fueled by the influence of this [epic playlist](https://music.apple.com/tr/playlist/%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B7%D1%8A%D1%91%D0%B1-%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D1%88%D0%B0%D1%88%D0%BB%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%85/pl.u-xlyNNaXFp0e0ZE).
